`7.1.2019 @ 2:13PM PST: Working on a huge update for the overlay `

`7.2.2019 @ 5:18AM PST: Code cleanup then will implement Design + Champions section`
  
`7.7.2019 @ 9:20PM PST: Apologies for the slow updates, was pretty much vacation week. Should ramp up again soon.`  

`7.14.2019 @ 2:56PM PST: Trying to add/fix multiple things at once seems to be slowing things down a bit. Once I finish everything I'm working on, I'll most likely stick to working on something 1 at a time. Also for people working on Localization, there are more strings you can copy from ItemStrings.xaml.

## How to use:
  -  [Download TFT Overlay](https://github.com/Just2good/TFT-Overlay/releases/)  
  -  Extract the file and run `TFT Overlay.exe`
  -  Right click Orange box for context menu  
  -  Click on Icons for information
