`7.14.2019 @ 2:56PM PST: Trying to add/fix multiple things at once seems to be slowing things down a bit. Once I finish everything I'm working on, I'll most likely stick to working on something 1 at a time. Also for people working on Localization, there are more strings you can copy from ItemStrings.xaml.
  
`7.16.2019 @ 9:55PM PST: Going to be slow for just a tiny bit longer, then I can spend hours coding again. Remember to DM me on discord or post an issue here with any feedback you may have.

`7.28.2019 @ 10PM PST: The Horizontal Bars (Opacity and Orange bar) will be changed. This is temporary until I get draggable tabs to work.
